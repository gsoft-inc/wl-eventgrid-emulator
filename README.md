# Workleap Azure Event Grid Emulator

This Docker image provides a local emulator for **Azure Event Grid**, which can be used for testing and development purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the EventGridEmulator Docker image, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com/get-started

## Getting started

To use the EventGridEmulator Docker image, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a development certificate ([for more info](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)):

    ```powershell
    .\devtools\Install-Certificate.ps1
    ```

    You should see something like:
    ```
    Installing localhost certificate...
    The local CA is already installed in the system trust store! üëç


    Created a new certificate valid for the following names üìú
    - "localhost"
    - "127.0.0.1"
    - "::1"
    - "host.docker.internal"

    The certificate is at "C:\Users\<user>\.eventgridemulator\localhost.crt" and the key at "C:\Users\<user>\.eventgridemulator\localhost.key" ‚úÖ

    It will expire on <dd mmmm yy> üìÖ

    Certificate installed successfully.
    ```

2. Option a) Using docker-compose file (**recommended**):

    ```yaml
    version: '3.4'

    services:
        eventgridemulator:
            image: eventgridemulator
            environment:
                - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
                - ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+:443;http://+:8080
                - KESTREL__CERTIFICATES__DEFAULT__PATH=/etc/ssl/certs/localhost.crt
                - KESTREL__CERTIFICATES__DEFAULT__KEYPATH=/etc/ssl/certs/localhost.key
            ports:
                - "6500:443"
            extra_hosts:
                - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
            volumes:
                - "~/.eventgridemulator:/etc/ssl/certs"
    ``` 
    You have to mount a volume to provide development certificates for https communication

    Option b) Using Docker Cli (*not recommended*):

    ```powershell
    docker run `
        --name eventgridemulator `
        -e "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development" `
        -e "ASPNETCORE_URLS=https://+:443;http://+:8080" `
        -e "KESTREL__CERTIFICATES__DEFAULT__PATH=/etc/ssl/certs/localhost.crt" `
        -e "KESTREL__CERTIFICATES__DEFAULT__KEYPATH=/etc/ssl/certs/localhost.key" `
        -p "6500:8080" `
        -v "$env:USERPROFILE\.eventgridemulator:/etc/ssl/certs" `
        eventgridemulator
    ```

   This will start the EventGridEmulator container and map port 6500 on your local machine to port 8080 in the container.

3. Now you have to configure your subscriptions. You can use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) With [Docker extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) to connect to your container file system. The configuration is `/app/appsetings.json`. Here is a sample content. We use `host.docker.internal` to access host endpoint outside the Docker container. This will resolve your host ip.
   
   ```json
    {
        "Topics": {
            "activities-eg": [
            "http://host.docker.internal:6000/webhook-200",
            "http://host.docker.internal:6000/webhook-400",
            "http://host.docker.internal:6000/webhook-missing"
            ],
            "comments-eg": [
            "http://host.docker.internal:6000/webhook-404",
            "http://host.docker.internal:6000/webhook-401",
            "http://host.docker.internal:6000/webhook-slow-200"
            ]
        }
    }
   ```

## Building, releasing and versioning

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's an example README.md file that explains how to use the EventGridEmulator Docker image:


# EventGridEmulator Docker Image

This Docker image provides a local emulator for Azure Event Grid, which can be used for testing and development purposes. 

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the EventGridEmulator Docker image, you need to have Docker installed on your machine. You can download Docker from the official website: https://www.docker.com/get-started

## Usage

To use the EventGridEmulator Docker image, you can follow these steps:

1. Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:

   ```
   docker pull workleap/eventgrid-emulator
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:

   ```
   docker run -p 8080:8080 workleap/eventgrid-emulator
   ```

   This will start the EventGridEmulator container and map port 8080 on your local machine to port 8080 in the container.

3. Send events to the emulator:

   You can now send events to the emulator by making HTTP POST requests to `http://localhost:8080/api/events`. The body of the request should contain the event data in JSON format.

   For example, you can use the `curl` command to send an event:

   ```
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"eventType": "myevent", "data": {"foo": "bar"}}' http://localhost:8080/api/events
   ```

4. Verify that the events were received:

   You can verify that the events were received by making an HTTP GET request to `http://localhost:8080/api/events`. This will return a list of all the events that were received by the emulator.
